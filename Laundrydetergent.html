     <h1>LAUNDRY DETERGENT SLIME</h1>
    
     <a href="Slime_5.html"><button>BACK TO HOME</button></a>
    
    <p class="one">Welcome to the Laundry Detergent Slime page! These recipies are really
    easy and fun to make because you just use ingredients that you can find
    at home! I hope you enjoy my Laundry Detergent Recipies!</p>

    <h2>Recipe #1</h2>
<p class="three">These are the ingredients you will need:</p>

<ul>
    <li>White Glue/Clear</li>
    <li>Tide</li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Make it!</h3>

<p class="four">First, pour your white/clear glue into your bowl. Next, add
your food dye (THIS IS OPTIONAL!) After that, add Tide
into your bowl. After that mix up your ingredients. Keep adding Tide and mixing
until you get the slime you enjoy best. If you use clear glue and want clear slime,
I suggest using clear Tide and you will end up with easy clear slime! If you
don't care about the look of your slime you could pour blue Tide into your mixture.
The only difference you will get is that you will end up with blue slime.</p>
