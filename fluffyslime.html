<h3>How to Make it!</h3>

<p class="four">First, pour your Elmers Glue into your bowl. Second, put in any food dye.
(Food dye is OPTIONAL!) Third, mix up your food dye into your glue! (If you 
did not choose to use food dye just skip this step.) Fourth, put your shaving
cream into the bowl and mix. (DO NOT PUT IN TO MUCH SHAVING CREAM OR ELSE IT
WON'T BE AS STRETCHY!) Fifth,after you have put in your shaving cream and
mixed it, you will add in your saline solution. Start by adding little bits
at a time and mixing until you get the feel you want.
Saline solution is used to bring together your slime. If your
slime is not coming together just keep adding saline solution and mixing!
Then you have your
slime!</p>
